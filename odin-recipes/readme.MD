# Odin Recipes

This is my first mini project for The Odin Project Foundations course. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## What I've Built

- A homepage linking to multiple recipe pages
- Individual recipe pages with ingredients and preparation steps

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing semantic HTML
- Using relative paths for internal linking
- Organizing a multi-page website
- Structuring content with headings, lists, and paragraphs

This project helped me practice the core building blocks of web development using HTML.
